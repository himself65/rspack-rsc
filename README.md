React Server Component + rspack

> Experimental

We costs a lot of work to polish the prod/dev difference using Vite in [waku](https://github.com/dai-shi/waku) ,
but even now, there are many issues when bundling many third-party libraries(vertical/ai, mui) with RSC because of Vite's limits.

Trying to find a way out with best performance + modern way
